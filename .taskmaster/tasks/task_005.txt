# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Gradient and Hessian Computations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop efficient and numerically stable gradient and Hessian computations for the primal objective function.
# Details:
Implement gradient and Hessian computations for the primal objective function, ensuring compatibility with the AbstractNLPModel interface. These implementations should be numerically stable and efficient.

Gradient implementation:
```julia
function NLPModels.grad!(model::DPModel, x::AbstractVector, g::AbstractVector)
    # Linear cost term gradient
    g .= model.c
    
    # Quadratic penalty term gradient
    residual = model.A * x - model.b
    penalty_grad = (1.0 / model.λ) * (model.A' * residual)
    g .+= penalty_grad
    
    # KL divergence regularization gradient
    for i in 1:length(x)
        if x[i] > 0
            g[i] += log(x[i] / model.x̄[i]) + 1
        elseif x[i] == 0
            g[i] += -Inf  # Subdifferential at boundary
        end
    end
    
    return g
end
```

Hessian-vector product implementation (for matrix-free operations):
```julia
function NLPModels.hprod!(model::DPModel, x::AbstractVector, v::AbstractVector, Hv::AbstractVector; obj_weight=1.0)
    # Quadratic penalty term Hessian-vector product
    Av = model.A * v
    penalty_hv = (obj_weight / model.λ) * (model.A' * Av)
    
    # KL divergence regularization Hessian-vector product
    for i in 1:length(x)
        if x[i] > 0
            Hv[i] = penalty_hv[i] + (obj_weight * v[i] / x[i])
        else
            Hv[i] = penalty_hv[i]  # Undefined at boundary, use limiting value
        end
    end
    
    return Hv
end
```

For explicit Hessian construction (when needed):
```julia
function NLPModels.hess(model::DPModel, x::AbstractVector; obj_weight=1.0)
    n = length(x)
    H = (obj_weight / model.λ) * (model.A' * model.A)  # Quadratic penalty term
    
    # Add KL divergence regularization Hessian (diagonal)
    for i in 1:n
        if x[i] > 0
            H[i,i] += obj_weight / x[i]
        end
    end
    
    return H
end
```

Implement specialized versions for sparse matrices when appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Test gradient and Hessian computations with:
1. Verify gradients using finite differences
2. Verify Hessian-vector products against explicit Hessian multiplication
3. Test with various problem sizes and sparsity patterns
4. Check numerical stability near boundaries of the feasible region
5. Verify that Hessian is positive definite for strictly feasible points
6. Benchmark performance against naive implementations
