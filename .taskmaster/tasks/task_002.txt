# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Basic Utility Functions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop essential utility functions for numerical stability, including log-sum-exp operations and Kullback-Leibler divergence calculations.
# Details:
Implement the following utility functions with numerical stability considerations:

1. Numerically stable log-sum-exp:
```julia
function logsumexp(x::AbstractVector)
    u = maximum(x)
    return u + log(sum(exp.(x .- u)))
end
```

2. Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability distributions:
```julia
function kl_divergence(p::AbstractVector, q::AbstractVector)
    result = 0.0
    for (pi, qi) in zip(p, q)
        if pi > 0
            result += pi * log(pi / qi)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

3. Scaled KL divergence for the regularization term:
```julia
function scaled_kl(x::AbstractVector, x̄::AbstractVector)
    sum(xi > 0 ? xi * log(xi / x̄i) : 0.0 for (xi, x̄i) in zip(x, x̄))
end
```

4. Safe logarithm and division operations:
```julia
safe_log(x) = x > 0 ? log(x) : -Inf
safe_div(x, y) = y != 0 ? x / y : (x == 0 ? 0.0 : Inf * sign(x))
```

Ensure all functions handle edge cases appropriately and maintain numerical stability.

# Test Strategy:
Test utility functions with:
1. Normal input ranges
2. Edge cases (zeros, very small values, very large values)
3. Verify against known analytical results
4. Test for numerical stability with ill-conditioned inputs
5. Benchmark performance against naive implementations
