  abstract = {Given a finite number of moments of an unknown density on a finite measure space, the best entropy estimate--that nonnegative density x with the given moments which minimizes the BoltzmannShannon entropy I(x):= x log x--is considered. A direct proof is given that I has the Kadec property in L--if Yn converges weakly to 37 and I(yn) converges to I(37), then yn converges to 37 in norm. As a corollary, it is obtained that, as the number of given moments increases, the best entropy estimates converge in LI norm to the best entropy estimate of the limiting problem, which is simply in the determined case. Furthermore, for classical moment problems on intervals with strictly positive and sufficiently smooth, error bounds and uniform convergence are actually obtained.},

  abstract = {Hausdorff moment problem is considered and a solution, consisting of the use of fractional moments, is proposed. More precisely, in this work a stable algorithm to obtain centered moments from integer moments is found. The algorithm transforms a direct method into an iterative Jacobi method which converges in a finite number of steps, as the iteration Jacobi matrix has null spectral radius. The centered moments are needed to calculate fractional moments from integer moments. As an application few fractional moments are used to solve finite Hausdorff moment problem via maximum entropy technique. Fractional moments represent a remedy to ill-conditioning coming from an high number of integer moments involved in recovering procedure.},

  abstract = {The method of maximum entropy has proven to be a rather powerful way to solve the inverse problem consisting of determining a probability density fS(s) on [0,{$\infty$}) from the knowledge of the expected value of a few generalized moments, that is, of functions gi(S) of the variable S. A version of this problem, of utmost relevance for banking, insurance, engineering and the physical sciences, corresponds to the case in which S{$\geq$}0 and gi(s)=exp(-{$\alpha$}is), the expected values E[exp(-{$\alpha$}iS)] are the values of the Laplace transform of S the points {$\alpha$}i on the real line. Since inverting the Laplace transform is an ill-posed problem, to devise numerical techniques that are efficient is of importance for many applications, especially in cases where all we know is the value of the transform at a few points along the real axis. A simple change of variables transforms the Laplace inversion problem into a fractional moment problem on [0,~1]. In this note, we examine why the maximum entropy method provides a good approximation to the density from a few fractional moments, or correspondingly, why a density can be recovered from a few values of its Laplace transform along the real axis.},
